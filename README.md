JSON files for the Mathematics Subjects Classification 2010 (MSC2010)

The Mathematics Subjects Classification is the common standard to classify maths into its subjects.
Working on a project, I had a hard time finding it in JSON format. 
Sharing it here if anyone else needs it and needs to save some time generating it. 
Enjoy!
